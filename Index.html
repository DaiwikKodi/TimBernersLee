            <p>
            Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist, invented the World Wide Web which is known as the WWW in 1989 while working at CERN.
                <br>
                <br>
                CERN stands for the European Council for Nuclear Research.
                <br>
                <br>
                The web was originally conceived and developed to meet the demand for automated information-sharing between scientists in universities and institutes around the world.
                <br>
                <br>
                It is basically like a huge messaging app eg: Whatsapp.
                <br>
                The project for the WWW was supported and funded by the US Mission in Geneva through the CERN.
